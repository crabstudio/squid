# Code of Conduct

The Squid Project is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form.

This code of conduct applies to all Squid Project spaces, including the mailing lists, IRC channel, bug tracker, wiki, and any other communication channel used by our community. Anyone who violates this code of conduct may be sanctioned or expelled from these spaces at the discretion of the Squid Project Steering Committee.
