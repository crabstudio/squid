## Other Configarations

Squid comes with a few other configarations that you can use to customize your app.

## Eslint

ESLint is a tool for identifying and reporting on patterns found in ECMAScript/JavaScript code, with the goal of making code more consistent and avoiding bugs. You can learn more about eslint [here](https://eslint.org/).

_When you select eslint, Squid will install eslint and configure it for you._

## Prettier

Prettier is an opinionated code formatter. It enforces a consistent style by parsing your code and re-printing it with its own rules that take the maximum line length into account, wrapping code when necessary. You can learn more about prettier [here](https://prettier.io/).

_When you select prettier, Squid will install prettier and configure it for you._

## Version Control

While installing Squid, you will be asked if you want to initialize a git repository. If you select yes, Squid will initialize a git repository for you.

```bash
? Do you want to initialize a git repository? (Y/n)
```

## Package Manager

```bash
